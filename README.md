# codex-relay

A lightweight Rust proxy that translates the OpenAI **Responses API** (used by [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)) into the **Chat Completions API**, letting Codex work with any OpenAI-compatible provider — DeepSeek, Kimi, Qwen, Mistral, Groq, xAI, OpenRouter, and more.

## Why

Codex CLI speaks the OpenAI Responses API, which is an OpenAI-proprietary stateful protocol. Every other provider exposes the standard Chat Completions API. `codex-relay` sits between Codex and your chosen provider, translating on the fly — no code changes to Codex required.

## Install

```bash
# From PyPI — prebuilt binary for your platform
pip install codex-relay

# From crates.io
cargo install codex-relay
```

## Quick start

**1. Start the relay**

```bash
CODEX_RELAY_UPSTREAM=https://api.deepseek.com/v1 \
CODEX_RELAY_API_KEY=$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY \
CODEX_RELAY_PORT=4446 \
codex-relay
```

On startup, the relay logs the available upstream models and prints a hint:

```
ℹ upstream models: deepseek-chat, deepseek-reasoner
⚠  To configure Codex with model metadata, run:  codex-relay --print-config --upstream ...
```

**2. Generate your Codex config**

```bash
codex-relay --print-config \
  --upstream https://api.deepseek.com/v1 \
  --api-key $DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
```

This prints a ready-to-use `~/.codex/config.toml` snippet that includes
`model_properties` for every upstream model, so Codex knows model capabilities
and you won't see the **"Model metadata … not found"** warning.

If you prefer to write the config by hand, here is the minimal form:

```toml
model = "deepseek-chat"
model_provider = "deepseek-relay"

[model_providers.deepseek-relay]
name = "DeepSeek"
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:4446/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
env_key = "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"

[model_properties."deepseek-chat"]
context_window = 262144
max_context_window = 1048576
supports_parallel_tool_calls = true
supports_reasoning_summaries = false
input_modalities = ["text"]
```

> ⚠️ **Without `model_properties`**, Codex CLI defaults to fallback metadata
> for any model it doesn't recognize natively. This can degrade performance,
> tool-call reliability, and context-window management. The relay logs a
> reminder at startup and offers `--print-config` to eliminate this class
> of problem entirely.

**3. Use Codex normally** — it routes through the relay transparently.

## Features

- **Streaming** — full SSE streaming with correct event sequencing
- **Tool calls** — accumulates streaming deltas and emits structured function_call items
- **Parallel tool calls** — consecutive function_call input items merged into one assistant message
- **Reasoning models** — preserves `reasoning_content` across turns (Kimi k2.6, DeepSeek-R1)
- **Model catalog** — proxies `/v1/models` from the upstream provider
- **Auto-config** — `--print-config` generates a complete Codex config with model metadata

## Python API

```python
from codex_relay import start

proc = start(port=4446, upstream="https://api.deepseek.com/v1", api_key="sk-...")
# ... use Codex ...
proc.terminate()
```

## Testing

Two layers — offline tests pin behavior against captured Codex wire-shape;
live tests pin behavior against real provider APIs.

## Debugging tool round-trips

For tool-routing issues, enable debug logs:

```bash
RUST_LOG=codex_relay=debug codex-relay
```

The relay logs tool names only, never tool arguments or message content:

- `response tools=...` — tools received from Codex's Responses API request
- `upstream tools=...` — tools forwarded to the Chat Completions upstream
- `upstream function_calls=...` — function calls returned by a blocking upstream response
- `upstream stream function_calls=...` — function calls returned by a streaming upstream response

These lines are useful for checking whether a tool such as `spawn_agent`
was preserved by the relay, and whether the failure happened before or after
the model selected that tool.

### Disk-backed history

By default, `codex-relay` keeps retained `previous_response_id` histories and
reasoning lookups in memory. For longer-running processes or deeper debugging,
you can opt into an inspectable on-disk store:

```bash
CODEX_RELAY_HISTORY_STORE=disk \
CODEX_RELAY_HISTORY_DIR=.codex-relay-history \
codex-relay
```

The disk backend writes JSON records under:

```text
.codex-relay-history/
  sessions/
  reasoning/
  turns/
```

Session records contain the translated Chat Completions `messages` retained for
a response id. Reasoning records keep call-id and turn-fingerprint lookups used
to round-trip provider reasoning content. The relay keeps only an in-memory
index for disk-backed entries and loads payloads on demand.

Treat this directory as sensitive: records may contain prompts, tool outputs,
and other conversation data. The same TTL/count/byte retention knobs apply to
disk-backed records, and evicted entries are removed from disk.

### Subagent tool routing

Codex subagent tools such as `spawn_agent`, `wait_agent`, and `close_agent`
are runtime tools. The relay can preserve them in the tool schema and round-trip
the model's selected function call, but it cannot reliably detect whether the
local Codex app-server daemon is new enough to execute those calls.

If Codex shows `unsupported call: spawn_agent`, first verify that the Codex CLI
and app-server daemon versions match. A stale daemon can expose a newer tool
schema to the model while lacking the handler that executes the returned call.
Also check your Codex config: `[features] subagents = true` is not recognized;
use `[features] multi_agent = true` only if you need to override the default.

As an escape hatch for affected runtimes, remove unsupported tools before they
reach the upstream model:

```bash
CODEX_RELAY_TOOL_DENYLIST=spawn_agent,wait_agent,close_agent codex-relay
```

The denylist matches the tool name forwarded to Chat Completions. Namespaced
MCP tools use their flattened name, for example
`mcp__codex_apps__github-_fetch_issue`.

**Offline (always green, default `cargo test`)**

Replays Codex CLI fixtures through the translation layer and asserts
role/tool/reasoning behavior. Each fixture pins a Codex CLI version under
`tests/fixtures/codex_<major>_<minor>_<patch>/`.

```bash
cargo test
```

**Live (gated on provider API key, `#[ignore]` by default)**

Spawns the relay binary on a random port, points it at the real provider, and
exercises `/v1/models`, blocking + streaming, tool calls, and (for thinking
models) the `reasoning_content` round-trip via an in-process recording proxy.

```bash
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-... cargo test --test compat_deepseek_live -- --ignored --test-threads=1
```

**Regenerating fixtures after a Codex upgrade**

1. Add a debug dump to the relay (write `body` bytes from `handle_responses`
   to a file before parsing).
2. Run a real `codex exec` against it; copy `inbound_*.json` to a new
   `tests/fixtures/codex_<major>_<minor>_<patch>/` folder.
3. Trim each payload down to the smallest one that exercises the feature you
   want to lock in.
4. Add a row to `tests/fixtures/VERSIONS.md` and a test pointing at the new
   directory.

The old fixture directory stays as a regression net so the relay keeps
working with the previous Codex CLI release.
